This project, completed as part of a **12-week Machine Learning course**, focuses on developing a **predictive model** to enhance the **home equity line of credit (HELOC) application process**. The model was designed with two key objectives:

**•	Predict the likelihood of loan default to help mitigate financial risk.**

**•	Identify key factors leading to loan rejections, ensuring transparency in decision-making.**

By leveraging **machine learning techniques**, this project demonstrates how predictive modeling can improve **loan approval processes** while maintaining compliance with fair lending regulations (e.g., the **Equal Credit Opportunity Act**). The model provides **interpretable outputs**, offering applicants clear reasons for loan denials while helping financial institutions optimize lending decisions and reduce default risks.

This repository includes:

**•	Data preprocessing & feature engineering**

**•	Model selection & evaluation (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests)**

**•	Interpretability techniques (e.g., SHAP, feature importance analysis)**

**•	Code for training, testing, and deploying the model**
