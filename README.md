To streamline the home equity line of credit application process, the bank tasked its data science team with creating a predictive model. This model was to serve two main objectives: (1) Predicting loan applicants who were likely to default on their loans. (2) Identifying key features that led to a loan rejections for an applicant. By leveraging this model, the bank aimed to enhance the loan application process while ensuring compliance with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and fair banking regulations. Customers will receive transparent reasons for loan denials, enabling them to understand the decision-making process. Meanwhile, the bank would benefit from offering loans to creditworthy customers, thereby optimizing its lending practices and mitigating risks associated with defaults.
