This project, completed as part of a *12-week Machine Learning course*, focuses on developing a predictive model to enhance the home equity line of credit (HELOC) application process. The model was designed with two key objectives:
1.	Predict the likelihood of loan default to help mitigate financial risk.
2.	Identify key factors leading to loan rejections, ensuring transparency in decision-making.
By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project demonstrates how predictive modeling can improve loan approval processes while maintaining compliance with fair lending regulations (e.g., the Equal Credit Opportunity Act). The model provides interpretable outputs, offering applicants clear reasons for loan denials while helping financial institutions optimize lending decisions and reduce default risks.
This repository includes:
•	Data preprocessing & feature engineering
•	Model selection & evaluation (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests)
•	Interpretability techniques (e.g., SHAP, feature importance analysis)
•	Code for training, testing, and deploying the model




To streamline the home equity line of credit application process, the bank tasked its data science team with creating a predictive model. This model was to serve two main objectives: (1) Predicting loan applicants who were likely to default on their loans. (2) Identifying key features that led to a loan rejections for an applicant. By leveraging this model, the bank aimed to enhance the loan application process while ensuring compliance with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and fair banking regulations. Customers will receive transparent reasons for loan denials, enabling them to understand the decision-making process. Meanwhile, the bank would benefit from offering loans to creditworthy customers, thereby optimizing its lending practices and mitigating risks associated with defaults.
